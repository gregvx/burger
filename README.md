# burger
A Sample MVC app with database deployed to Heroku

The site asks the user to enter the name of a hamburger to "create" it. When the user does so, a new row is added to the database, indicating the name of the burger and it's devoured status (initially set to false.)
After the burger is added to the database, the page updates it's content to show the burger on the left side of the page with any and all other created burgers that have not yet been eaten, and the page provides a link next to each burger with the text "East Me" to allow the user to "eat" the burger, updating it's devoured status in the database and updating the content of the page to show the burger on the right hand side with other burgers that have been "eaten".

The app is deployed to Heroku, and can be viewed
